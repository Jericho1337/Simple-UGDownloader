Album: One-X
 
[Intro]
A# Dm  A# Dm  A# Dm  Am C
 
[Verse]
A# Dm                    A# Dm            A#
   This world will never be what I expected
Dm                Am   C
And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it
A# Dm                A#   Dm                A#
   I will not leave alone everything that I own
Dm                         Am
To make you feel like it's not too late 
C
 It's never too late
 
[Chorus]
Dm A#           Am
   Even if I say   
C            Dm
It'll be alright
A#                   Am          C           Dm
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
    A#               Am      C
Now and again we try to just stay alive
A#           Dm                              Am
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'cause it's not too late
C
 It's never too late
 
[Verse]
A# Dm               A#  Dm
   No one will ever see this side reflected
A# Dm                        Am    C
   And if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it
A# Dm               A#   Dm                A#
   And I have left alone everything that I own
Dm                         Am
To make you feel like it's not too late
C
 It's never too late
 
[Chorus]
Dm A#           Am
   Even if I say   
C            Dm
It'll be alright
A#                   Am          C           Dm
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
    A#               Am      C
Now and again we try to just stay alive
A#           Dm                              Am
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'cause it's not too late
C
 It's never too late
 
[Bridge]
    A#            F     C
The world we knew won't come back
    A#               F     C
The time we've lost, can't get back
    A#          F     C        A#    Am C
The life we had won't be ours again
A# Dm                    A# Dm
   This world will never be what I expected
A# Dm               C
   And if I don't belong 
 
[Chorus]
Dm A#           Am
   Even if I say   
C            Dm
It'll be alright
A#                   Am          C           Dm
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
    A#               Am      C
Now and again we try to just stay alive
A#           Dm                              Am
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'cause it's not too late
C
 It's never too late
A#           Dm                              Am
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'cause it's not too late
C                                    A# Dm
 It's never too late (It's never too la-ate)
Am
It's not too late
C
 It's never too late
