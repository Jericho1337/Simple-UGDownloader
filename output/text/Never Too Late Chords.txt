G# Cm  G# Cm  G# Cm  Gm A#
 
[Verse]
G# Cm                    G# Cm            G#
   This world will never be what I expected
Cm                Gm   A#
And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it
G# Cm                G#   Cm                G#
   I will not leave alone everything that I own

Still I hear you say you want to end your life
    G#               Gm      A#
Now and again we try to just stay alive
G#           Cm                              Gm
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'cause it's not too late
